## About

EasyHonorMoney is a World of Warcraft Cataclism Classic Addon which provides flexible ui with some features which help users to automatically buy, equip, sell honor items.

## How it works ?

There're 4 commands, but 3 usable atm.

I recommend to create macros for them. (in future gonna add ui and features like comparing items by price and profit)

For work you need to speak with "Sergeant Major Clate" (which is in stormwind), and use as commands described below, in chat or macroses.

1. /ehm_b or /EHM_B or /EasyHonorMoney_Buy (Buy items, pretty fast)
2. /ehm_e or /EHM_E or /EasyHonorMoney_Equip (Equip items, pretty fast)
3. /ehm_s or /EHM_S or /EasyHonorMoney_Sell (Sell items, pretty fast)
4. /ehm or /EHM or /EasyHonorMoney (This does all together but it's very slow and may be bugs)
