## About

EasyHonorMoney is a World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria Classic addon designed to help players earn gold efficiently by automating the process of buying, equipping, and selling honor items.

It features a user-friendly interface to maximize your profit with minimal effort.

## How It Works

To get started, speak with one of the supported merchants (vendors), such as "Sergeant Major Clate" in Stormwind or "First Sergeant Hola'mahi" in Orgrimmar.

If you're unsure where to find them:
1. Type /ehm in chat.
2. Open the “Merchants” section.
3. Click on any merchant in the list.
This will create a waypoint on your map to their location.

⚠️ Note: You need the TomTom addon installed to see waypoints.
Blizzard’s built-in waypoint system isn’t available in Classic like it is in Retail.
TomTom is currently the only addon that integrates with Blizzard's API for this feature.
