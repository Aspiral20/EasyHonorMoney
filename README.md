## About

EasyHonorMoney is a World of Warcraft Cataclism Classic Addon which provides flexible ui with some features which help users to automatically buy, equip, sell honor items.

## How it works ?

There are 4 commands available, but only 3 are usable at the moment.

I recommend creating macros for them. (A UI and more features like item price and profit comparison will be added in the future)

To use the addon, speak with Sergeant Major Clate (located in Stormwind), then use the commands described below, either in chat or through macros.

## Commands
1. /ehm_b or /EHM_B or /EasyHonorMoney_Buy – Buys items (pretty fast)
2. /ehm_e or /EHM_E or /EasyHonorMoney_Equip – Equips items (pretty fast)
3. /ehm_s or /EHM_S or /EasyHonorMoney_Sell – Sells items (pretty fast)
4. /ehm or /EHM or /EasyHonorMoney – Performs all actions (buy, equip, sell), but it's slower and may have bugs
